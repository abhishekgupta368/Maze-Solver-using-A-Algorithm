# Maze-Solver-using-A-Algorithm
In Project, I used one of famous technique to solve maze which is A* Search algorithm.This algorithm will use two value which edge value and heuristic value to calculate nearest possible node and like it solve whole maze.


As we given maze, In Which 1 represent unblocking state and 0 represent blocking state

After performing A* search, we got
